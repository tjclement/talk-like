'Ooh, very good. Would you like the deposit defrayed from the cost of a Jumbo Cherry Squishie?',
'Oh, it is good to see you are learning a trade.',
'Michael Jackson! Oh such a thing happens once in a blue moon. Do I dare to leave my post?',
'He\'s three hundred pounds.',
'Otto! Welcome!',
'Oh, Otto. Otto, did you know there\'s a small child inside your bus?',
'Are, are there any women here?',
'Are you a beautiful woman?',
'This is not the sort of party as I had anticipated.',
'Colonel! You\'ve got to do something!',
'Here you go.',
'Oh congratulations, Mr. Homer!',
'If I could just see the ticket...',
'Please to be removing your thumb.',
'Yes. Please, I must insist...',
'I\'ve got to look at the ticket',
'Yes, I must...',
'A cherry! Oh, Mr. Homer, what has reduced you to such cheap chicanery?',
'Well, if you need money you should have at least jammed a gun in my head or better yet you could inquire about my Help Wanted sign.',
'Yes. We need someone for the demanding, yet high-profile midnight to eight a.m. shift.',
'You\'re hired.',
'Always I dreamed the day would come when one of you would be working for me!',
'I won\'t lie to you. On this job you will be shot at.',
'Each of these bullet wounds is a badge of honor.',
'Here\'s a pointer: try to take it in the shoulder.',
'Now, these hot dogs have been here for three years. They are strictly ornamental. There\'s only one bozo who comes in and buys them.',
'Homer, are you stealing Squishees?',
'I\'m sorry, baby. While I am here pleasuring you, my store is going down the tubes.',
'Homer! You are asleep at your post! Now go change the expiration dates on the dairy products.',
'Sorry baby, date\'s over.',
'What--- wha, da, you call this melted cheese receptacle clean? Eh, the young man you replaced is rolling over in his grave.',
'He slept, he stole, he was rude to the customers... still, there goes the best damn employee a convenience store ever had.',
'The canary!',
'Ah, Chef Lonely Hearts\' Soup For One.',
'Mrs. Krabappel, I haven\'t seen you since we doubled our prices. Still teaching?',
'Such a mighty wallop.',
'Ooh, they used nylon rope this time. It feels so smooth against my skin. Almost sensuous.',
'Yes, yes, here\'s your lottery ticket. Thank you for knocking over my inventory. Please come again.',
'Strap on your bullet proof vest, Sanjay. It\'s time for another bank run.',
'I promise nothing.',
'Perhaps you\'d like to try an experimental flavor of my own concoction. A delicious Chutney-Squishee.',
'You can really taste the chutney.',
'I am Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. I play Steve.',
'I\'M COLLECTING FOR THE EVENING STAR.',
'I AM JUST A SIMPLE PAPER BOY / NO ROMANCE DO I SEEK / I JUST WANTED FORTY CENTS / FOR MY DELIVERIES LAST WEEK.',
'WILL THIS BEWITCHING FLOOZY / SEDUCE THIS HUMBLE NEWSIE?/ OH WHAT\'S A PAPERBOY TO DO?',
'WHOO-HOO.',
'Oh, but I am. I have a shrine to Ganesha, the god of worldly wisdom, located in the employee lounge.',
'Please do not offer my god a peanut.',
'Mr. Simpson, please pay for your purchases and get out and come again.',
'Fire at the old Simpson place!',
'You are on your honor not to steal anything.',
'Little Jamshed... the store is in your hands.',
'You ducks are really trying my patience. But you\'re so cute.',
'Hindu. There are 700 million of us.',
'I am thinking you like this girl, yes?',
'My ceiling mirrors and video cameras sometimes see more than who is about to shoot me.',
'Thank you, Mr. Plow. Now my store can remain open.',
'Poor Mister Homer. Could it be that my snack treats are responsible for his wretched health?',
'Would you like some vodka with that?',
'Get to the money!',
'Pardon me, but I would like to see this money spent on more police officers. I have been shot eight times this year, and as a result I almost missed work.',
'Is there a chance the track could bend?',
'Is there a chance the track could bend?',
'Is there a chance the track could bend.',

'I lowered the price because an escaped mental patient tampered with the bottle.',
'Oh dear, the alarm must be broken. If you could just move a bit to your left...',
'Eight foot, six... Oh Sanjay, help Mrs. Simpson with her bag... and-while-you\'re-at-it... Uske coat ke tharaf dekho.',
'Mrs. Simpson! You did not pay for this bottle of Colonel Kwik-E-Mart\'s Kentucky Bourbon.',
'No offense, but we\'re putting that bitch on ice.',
'I\'m sorry, Mr. Homer, but it is the policy of the Kwik-E-Mart and its parent corporation, NorDyne Defense Dynamics, to prosecute shoplifters to the full extent of the law.',
'No. In fact I can recite pi to 40,000 places. The last digit is one!',
'You are wearing a red and white striped club tie, in a half Windsor knot.',
'But, if I am wrong about that, maybe I am wrong about Mrs. Simpson.',
'With her behind bars, our store is secure.',
'Hello...',
'GOODBYE...',
'SHOP KWIK-E-MART AND SAVE...',

'Twelve dollars.',
'Last year on that stupid Dame Edna special.',
'If you can think of a better way to get ice, I\'d like to hear it.',
'Oooh! A head bag! Those are chock full of... heady goodness.',
'This is not a library!',
'I have problems with...',
'Cowabunga!',
'No, you must not blame yourself, reverend. You must blame that little boy! He started it all!',
'Hello, gents. What will it be?',
'Entirely out of... An all-syrup Super-Squishee? S-such a thing has never been done.',
'Oh dear...',
'Won\'t be long. She won\'t hold! She\'s breaking up! All done. If you survive, please come again.',
'Please throw the dice now, please now!',
'Thank you for coming. I\'ll see you in Hell.',
'You\'re so good.',
'I didn\'t do it!',
'Oh no, it is encrusted with filth.',
'That\'s a dollar eighty-five.',
'Four-twenty.',
'Surprisingly expensive.',
'Silly customer! You cannot hurt a Twinkie!',
'Jiminy cricket, whew, expired ham!',
'Well, this time I\'ve gone too far. No, no one will fall for...',
'I\'m so sorry. Please accept five pounds of frozen shrimp.',
'Okay, ten pounds.',
'Your headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir. Perhaps you have a bee in your bonnet.',
'La, la, la, la, la.',
'Well, time to replenish the hot dog roller.',
'La, la, l- Oop.',
'Oh, well... let\'s sell it anyway.',
'Now this is just between me and you, smashed hat.',
'No! I mean, yes! I mean... uh-oh.',
'I think I come off very well.',
'But sir, I was only following standard procedure.',
'Uh huh. And if I can obtain for you these animals...',
'',
'Ooh.',
'Fired after all these years of loyal service. I don\'t want to live anymore!',
'No, I don\'t want to live, sir.',
'What do I do now? I\'ve been drummed out of my profession. I am a disgrace.',
'Even this babbling brook sounds almost like mocking laughter.',
'This is all because of Homer Simpson.',
'It is time to settle the score.',
'Mr. Simpson, you misunderstand me. In my village this is the traditional pose of apology.',
'You know, now that I think about it, it may be a little confusing. Many have died needlessly. I have come to make amends. At first I blamed you for squealing, but then I realized it was I who wronged you. So I have come to work off my debt. I am at your service.',
'I am selling only the concept of karmic realignment.',
'He\'s got me there.',
'It is an honor to begin repaying my debt to you. Back in Rhamatpur, I was considered quite the gourmet.',
'A napkin.',
'Good morning, sir!',
'Relax, please. You do not have anything I have not seen before. What the...?',
'Well, they\'ll never move that way.',
'Please, Mrs. Simpson. I... I can not go there. That is the scene of my spiritual depantsing.',
'Great selection and rock bottom prices. But where is the love?',
'Oh, Mrs. Simpson, the Express Line is the fastest line - not always. That old man up front, he is starved for attention. He will talk the cashier\'s head off.',
'Let\'s go to that line.',
'Yes, but look - all pathetic, single men - only cash, no chit-chat.',
'Thank you all for the kind praise.',
'I feel that way too. You see, whether igloo, hut, or lean-to/ or a geodesic dome / There\'s no structure I have been to / which I\'d rather call my home...',

'NOT ME!',
'NOT ME!',
'WHO NEEDS THE KWIK-E-MART? I DO.',
'I can\'t lie to myself, you know... I do miss my Kwik-E-Mart.',
'I must go to the head office and appeal my case.',
'But, sir, the head office is in India.',
'I\'m sorry we couldn\'t take a cab, but I spent my last dollar on the plane tickets.',
'No.',
'No.',
'No.',
'No. Oh wait. Nnnnow we are.',
'There she is, there she is, the world\'s first convenience store.',
'Must you dump on everything we do?',
'He is the benevolent, enlightened president and CEO of Kwik-E-Mart, and in Ohio, Stop-O-Mart. He is the one I must ask for my job back.',
'That\'s great, because all I need is one.',
'But, I must --',
'But...',
'Do you mind? I\'m not in the mood.',
'Yes, yes you are right, sir. I\'ve got to accept my fate. I have feared it for long enough now. I\'m going to go down to the Kwik-E-Mart and I\'m going to face my demon.',
'Ah, my old Squishee machine.',
'And my scumbucket with fly.',
'And the hot check list.',
'Oh, yes. It was horrible. I\'ll tell you. By the end I thought I was a hummingbird of some kind.',
'In a few minutes, I try to drink nectar out of Sanjay\'s head.',
'Noooooo!',
'Ah! The searing kiss of hot lead--how I missed you! I mean, I think I\'m dying.',
'Oh, oh, Mr. Woods, you\'re...',
'Young men! Your gargantuan cone is making a mockery of our self-serve policy!',
'Oh you have got to be kidding, sir! First, you think of an idea that has already been done! And then, you give it a title that nobody could possibly like!! Didn\'t you think this thr... it was on the best-seller list for 18 months! And every magazine cover...one of the most popular movies of all time! What were you thinking?! I mean, thank you, come again.',
'Sixteen brand new gas pumps! At last we can compete with the Gas and Gulp!',
'Excuse me, your honor. Yes, I\'d like to bring something to the court\'s attention.',
'What slip up? What are you talking about? He confessed it.',
'Oh my God! This boy is having an out-of-body experience! This is very bad for business!',
'I don\'t understand.',
'Uh, Mrs. Simpson, it may interest you to know we are having a sale on blue dye number fifty-two. It is your hair color, I believe.',
'Ooh, she\'s gotta have it.',
'Oh, no. Our goalie cannot stand up. Tell you what. Get some rope.',
'Defense! Defense! Come on, you call that blowing?!',
'What the... Y\'know, I wonder... if her skills will transfer over to the game of hockey. Well, only one way to be sure. Heads up little girl!',
'The goalie of my dreams! Let\'s try a hard one to make sure it wasn\'t a fluke.',
'Yeah, that\'s it, Milhouse! Keep up the chatter!',
'We are having our best season ever. And I would like to say that it is because of teamwork. Gee, but who am I kidding, huh? It\'s all because of Lisa.',
'Stop it! Stop it! Conserve your precious hatred for the game.',
'Stop \'em dead, little girl!',
'Hey, hey, hey! I have asked you nicely not to mangle my merchandise. You leave me no choice but to ask you nicely again.',
'Oh Mr. Simpson, I have just heard about the little bundle of joy. Congratulations, sir.',
'If you are going, I\'m going.',
'How could I charge full price to the man whose lust for filthy magazines kept me in business during that first shaky year? By the way, here is your new issue of Gigantic Asses.',
'Help, help, police!',
'So, you are the new cop on the beat. Okay, I know the drill. What will it be? One hundred? Two hundred?',
'Yes. Of course you don\'t. I will just leave this money on the table with my unseeing back to the money on the table.',
'Listen, someone\'s got to get that Mr. Burns. Uh, where\'s a gun-toting low-life when you need one?',
'Be careful when we capture him! We cannot claim the reward unless we have fifty-one per cent of the carcass.',
'Sanjay, to the entrance with the Windex. Sanjay, to the entrance with the Windex.',
'I take it from your yelling that you like my tofu dogs.',
'No, I don\'t eat any food that comes from an animal.',
'Oh, yes. No meat whatsoever, and only thrice the fat of a normal hot dog. I made the switch and nobody noticed.',
'Because I\'m a vegetarian. Haven\'t you ever seen my T-shirt?',
'Yeah. Let me show you something, Lisa.',
'You know, it\'s never come up.',
'Yes, this is where I come when I need some refuge from the modern world. Or when I want to see drive-in movies for free.',
'I know it is not easy to be a vegetarian, Lisa.',
'Back then I was known as the fifth Beatle.',
'You know what, Lisa, Paul and Linda are vegetarians too. In fact, Linda has her own line of vegetarian entrees.',
'Cheese?!',
'Yes, indeed I do think that. But, I learned long ago, Lisa, to tolerate others rather than forcing my beliefs on them. You know you can influence people without badgering them always. It\'s like Paul\'s song, Live and Let Live.',
'Well, whatever, whatever. It had a good rhythm.',
'I\'m Sergeant Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Man... I hope I will enjoy my show...',
'Yes!',
'I\'m hoping you enjoy this movie. It made every Indian critic\'s top 400 list.',
'That I cannot bowl wreaks havoc with my self-esteem as well. But who am I to complain?',
'Oh, forget this. I am far too fragile to withstand an evening of barbs like that.',
'MAKE THIS SPARE I\'LL GIVE YOU FREE GELATTO...',
'We will never possess it. The Holy Rollers have won it five years in a row.',
'Whoo! They begged me to join their team. Begged me.',
'Yes. I am afraid that I am going to have to make a similar threat with my name in place of Moe\'s name.',
'At last, I finally have a garment fine enough to be married in.',
'Yes.',
'Okay. The Holy Rollers are ahead by one pin and we only have one bowler left... Mr. Burns.',
'But we were a team, Sir.',
'THE DREAM POLICE / THEY LIVE INSIDE OF MY BED / THE DREAM POLICE POLICE / THEY COME TO ME IN MY HEAD / THE DREAM POLICE / THEY COME TO ARREST ME NOW / OH, NOOOO.... ',
'Howdy, neighbor! May I spray you with the hose in a playful fashion?',
'Oh, yes, indeed. I\'ve got nothing but time until they fix that malfunctioning Squishee machine.',
'Oh, Mrs. Simpson, you are looking very prosperous today. Might I interest you in some of our impulse items here by the cash register? Perhaps a crazy motorized wiggle pen? Look at the craziness.',
'Yes, I\'m sorry, I do not speak English. Okay.',
'Yes, yes! Hot dog! Hot dog! Yessir, no sir, maybe, okay!',
'Shiva H. Vishnu! Where is that noise coming from?',
'Well, of course you can, you little pixie! Woo! You are just as sweet as the stix which bear your name.',
'No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Take that down! As a semi-legal immigrant, your poster could land me in a predicament as red-hot as the candies which bear that name.',
'I, too, owe many thanks to Lester and Eliza. This is a great vindication for anybody who was ever taking a bath, went to get the paper, fell down, and had the door slam behind them and the doorknob break off.',
'Listen, serving the customer is merriment enough for me.',
'Thank you. Come again. You see? Most enjoyable.',
'Well... I don\'t like to leave the store, but...',
'For the next five minutes, I\'m going to party like it\'s on sale for $19.99!',
'Quick! Quick! No time to cook them -- they will plump in my stomach!',
'Helloo, beautiful! No ring, I see. So, you are only arranged to be married.',
'Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love this song. Let us boogie!',
'I AM A FREAK-A-ZOID / COME ON AND WIND ME UP! Phew, I am hot. Let us get out of here.',
'Don\'t worry, I\'ll tell everybody you were untouchable.',
'Oh, Sanjay, never have I partied so hearty! Same time, next year, ya?',
'Made it! And with one minute to spare!',
'Ah... Mr. Simpson? It may astonish you to learn that I am an immigrant.',
'No. In truth, an illegal immigrant, Sir. If Proposition 24 passes, I shall be forced to leave this country.',
'Oh, I wish... Oh, I wish I could have stayed just one more year or two. There was so much I wanted to see and to do and to have done to me.',
'Make the protesters go away and I\'ll give you the entire bottle.',
'Oh, thank goodness. My first customers in a week.',
'Alas, it is true. I came here shortly after my graduation from Cal Tech -- Calcutta Technical Institute...',
'As the top student in my graduating class of 7 million, I was accepted for graduate study in the United States.',
'Wherever you go and whatever you do, we will always love you. Make us proud, son.',
'Never forget who you are.',
'I won\'t, mother. And I won\'t forget you, Manjula. I\'m so sorry our arranged marriage will not come to pass.',
'I enrolled at Springfield Heights Institute of Technology under the tutelage of the brilliant Professor John Frink.',
'Could it be used for dating?',
'Nine glorious years later, I completed my Ph.D. thesis.',
'200,000 precisely-ordered punch cards comprising the world\'s very first tic-tac-toe program. Only the top human players could beat it.',
'',
'I did not feel right leaving without paying off my student loans.',
'So I took a job at the Kwik-E-Mart. When my debts were wiped clean, I was all set to go, but by then I had made so many friends here.',
'Oh, you are one of the good ones.',
'Hey, Kearney, this fake I.D., it is truly excellent.',
'Say, if you tell me where you obtained it, I\'ll overlook the ice cream sandwiches concealed in your armpits. Eh?',
'Most humble and grateful thanks to you.',
'Hey there, Homer, how\'s it hangin\'?',
'Oh, you\'re just noticing the way I\'m talking to you now. You see, it turns out I am an American citizen after all.',
'Apparently, I just plumb forgot about it. Say, let\'s take a relaxed attitude toward work and watch the baseball match. The NY Mets are my favorite squadron.',
'Oh yeah, what was I thinking with that? Who needs the infinite compassion of Ganesha when I\'ve got Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman staring at me from Entertainment Weekly with their dead eyes?',
'Look at me. I\'ve betrayed my Indian heritage, Sir. What would my parents think of me now?',
'Oh, forgive me, Mother, Father, I failed you!',
'Who am I kidding. I am no citizen. This passport is a cheap forgery. A cheap two thousand dollar forgery.',
'I have brought shame to my parents, to my homeland, and to myself.',
'',
'I cannot deny my roots and I can not keep up this charade. I only did it because I love this land, where I have the freedom to say and to think and to charge whatever I want. I want to stay, but as the real me -- not as some yahoo from Green Bay.',
'Store credit only.',
'That\'s nice, although three of you are below voting age.',
'I do appreciate your concern, really, but it is hopeless. The latest poll shows a whooping 85% support for Proposition 24.',
'Oh, listen, it is hopeless. Poor Apu....',
'Seven years, but I don\'t--',
'Oh no. That is not nearly enough time to learn over 200 years of American history.',
'It appears to be the flag which disappeared from the public library last year.',
'Because this particular flag is ridiculously out of date. The library must have purchased it during the brief period in 1912 after New Mexico became a state but before Arizona did.',
'I\'m so confused! I don\'t even know where I\'m getting kicked out of anymore.',
'...Executive, legislative, and, uh, judicial.',
'Please, Mr. Simpson, my brain needs sleep. The test is in six hours, and many of these facts you speak of are completely new to me.',
'Okay, Apu: stay awake and stay focused. Cotton Mather...',
'Oh no! I fell asleep. I have forgotten everything that Mr. Homer taught me!',
'Actually, there were numerous causes. Aside from the obvious schism between abolitionists and anti-abolitionists, economic factors both domestic and international played a significant--',
'What?',
'Slavery it is, Sir.',
'Yes! I\'m a citizen! Now, which way to the welfare office?',
'I\'m kidding, I\'m kidding. I work. I work.',
'Thank you. I want to say thank you to everyone. From this day forth, I am no longer an Indian living in America. I am an Indian-American!',
'Like me.',
'Please don\'t knock the land that I love. Jury duty! Oh. Today, I am truly an American citizen.',
'My apologies, sir, but the sale of fireworks is prohibited in this state and is punishable by--',
'Follow me.',
'Any red-blooded, flag-fearing American would love the M-320. Celebrate the independence of your nation by blowing up a small part of it.',
'Hello. I am not interested in buying the house, but I would like to use your restroom, flip through your magazines, re-arrange your carefully shelved items, and handle your food products in an unsanitary manner. Ha! Now you know how it feels.',
'Good-bye.',
'THE EXTRA ARMS ON VISHNU!',
'Good morning. One donut with sprinkles, and... Wait a minute -- these are not sprinkles, Sir!',
'You have clearly taken items from the candy rack and placed them on top of the donut in an attempt to pass them off as sprinkles!',
'A Mounds bar is not a sprinkle! A Twizzler is not a sprinkle! A Jolly Rancher is not a sprinkle, Sir! -- Perhaps in Shangri-la they are, but not here!',
'Thank you, come again.',
'Stand behind the flaming garbage cans! We\'ll be letting you into the store seventy people at a time.',
'No, no, no! Do not listen to that man. Remain calm. You will all have a chance to be gouged.',
'Now, this is the room with electricity, but it has too much electricity. So I don\'t know, you might want to wear a hat.',
'And a cement mixer full of hope and some cement.',
'The South shall come again!',
'FOR MEAT --',
'AND MILK --',
'FROM 1984...',
'Everybody... everybody get naked! Come on, don\'t be stuck up, it\'s going to be great!',
'Wow!',
'Just put an X, then call yourself whatever the hell you want.',
'FOR NO REASON HERE\'S APU --',
'THOSE WERE THE DAYYYYYS.',
'Don\'t forget the smell!',
'Why don\'t you make me?',
'He\'s blind as a bat!',
'',
'Oh, don\'t shoot. Just take the money and get out.',
'Such a product does not exist, sir. I think you must have dreamed it.',
'Oh, no, no. Please, I am nothing special.',
'Oh, um... Well... I have a doctorate in computer science.',
'Umm, I run my own business, of course.',
'I do like to cook. I\'m not much of a talker, but I love to listen. And in my leisure time, I like to build furniture and then to have a discussion about where it could be placed in a room.',
'Holy moley!',
'Come on...',
'Oh, yes. All Kwik-E-Mart managers must be skilled in the deadly arts.',
'Oof. That date will not be easy to top.',
'But we shall see...',
'Why don\'t you try and stop me?',
'This is just a note to say, I think about you every day. And when I get you all alone... Well, it gets a little bit personal, here.',
'I know.',
'Tell me about it.',
'Oh, here\'s one from my mother.',
'',
'No, no. It is the sign that it is time for my arranged marriage!',
'No, no, no. Don\'t you know what it means?',
'It all happened shortly after my eighth birthday...',
'Ten goats and an electric fan? You call that a dowry?',
'Then it is agreed. Your third daughter will marry our first son.',
'Oh, I cannot get married. I\'m just beginning to enjoy my bachelorhood. Ah, what am I going to do?!',
'No, no, no, no, you do not know Mother. She will never quit until I am married.',
'No, no. I cannot lie to my mother.',
'Yes, that is right, mother. I already got married... Why did not I bother to tell you? Well, uh, the reason is...',
'Well, I guess I... I didn\'t-think-you\'d-understand. Oh, got-to-go. Bye-bye-bye. I love-you. Love-you.',
'It worked! It worked! The lie has set me free!!',
'I am sorry, you do not have enough for both.',
'I\'m not the type to kiss and tell, sir, but listen to this...',
'It is my mother!',
'Oh, no! Oh, no! What am I going to do?!',
'Bu... Don\'t you see?! She is here to meet my wife.',
'The wife that I told her I had. I do not have a wife.',
'Oh, she\'s going to be here any second!',
'Oh, yes, that\'ll buy me some time. Homer, you\'ve got to help me!',
'What?! What?! What?! What?! What?!',
'Is it me, or do your plans always involve some horrible web of lies?',
'Welcome to the Kwik-E-Mart. May I help... Mother! What are you doing here?',
'I have come to meet this wife of yours.',
'And meet her you shall. It is a very reasonable request that can easily be granted in a timely and efficient...',
'Let\'s go.',
'And go we shall, because it is in the going that we at-tat-tat-tat-tat!',
'Honey, I am in my home.',
'Mother, I would like for you to meet my darling wife of many, many good years, Mmmarge.',
'I have come to see the woman for whom Apu was willing to disgrace his family and spit on his culture.',
'Thank you. And having met you, let me say how deeply, deeply disappointed I am. Apu, your arranged bride Manjula is a sweet, refined, chaste woman! Are you nuts?',
'Ach, Mother, come on, you know that one out of every 25 arranged marriages ends in divorce. Heh.',
'I cannot believe you did not tell me I had two grandchildren.',
'Oh, I must apologize for the inconvenience, Marge. You are a real sport.',
'Oh, it should not be more than a few days. She really, truly hates you.',
'What would you like to know?',
'You tell me.',
'Surely, you children are aware of your Brahman heritage.',
'Okay Apu, I am packed and ready to go to the airpor...',
'',
'Oh, my God!',
'Marge, how could you?!',
'Mother, I am so sorry. I lied to you about being married.',
'But the fact that I would stage this ridiculous farce surely proves to you how much I do not want to go through with this arranged marriage.',
'I had no idea how strongly you felt, Apu.',
'Now wipe that smile off your face. We have a wedding to plan.',
'',
'Yeah, shut up.',
'Oh, would you shut up.',
'I can\'t believe you don\'t shut up.',
'Yes, yes, Manjula, I will take care of all the wedding plans. You just get on the plane and come to America...',
'I have to go. Believe me, I\'d like to.',
'Oof, Manjula and I have not seen each other in twenty years. Two people cannot fall in love sight-unseen.',
'Well, just twenty-four hours of freedom left...',
'WELL, I\'M HOT BLOODED / CHECK IT AND SEE / I\'VE GOT A FEVER OF A HUNDRED AND THREE...',
'How\'s that fire ring coming? Is it sacred yet?',
'Can you believe it? Tradition forbids me even to speak to the woman I am about to spend my life with. Hmf, has the whole world gone crazy?',
'Your old friend Apu is a lamb being led to the slaughter.',
'Oof, I am really doomed. Only the gods could stop this wedding now.',
'Hello, everyone... What a happy, happy day.',
'Lucky mouse.',
'Oh, Manjula?!',
'Ooobviously not.',
'Oh, God.',
'Oh, I\'m afraid this is all my fault, Manjula. To be perfectly honest with you, I have not exactly been looking forward to this arranged marriage.',
'All right, Ganesh has been subdued.',
'Resume the ceremony.',
'Oh, quickly, tell me, what is your favorite movie, book, and food?',
'Oo, that... that is good.',
'Oh, I am so torn. You are clearly so quick-witted and beautiful.',
'Oh, do you think this marriage could really work?',
'Of course! God bless America!',
'Well, so far, so good. Don\'t you think? I cannot wait to show you our apartment.',
'Oh!',
'My goodness, there is over $15,000 here.',
'Hey, speak for yourself.',
'Hey, look who\'s here, everybody.',
'Consider your debt repaid, neighbor.',
'Look at the outrageous mark-up! You magnificent bastard, I salute you!',
'Woo! I have been zinged and I love it.',
'Oh, looks like somebody\'s hoggin\' dazs ice cream! Oh, I should write these down.',
'You\'ll have it in forty-five seconds, sir.',
'To pass the time, please enjoy this novelty pen.',
'Look at this mess! Where is that elderly old man?',
'Old man? Old ma...',
'Wait a minute... There is a note!',
'Please, young customers! Ignore the frozen gentlemen and return to your impulse buying.',
'No! This is a convenience store, not a freak show!',
'Come one, come all! See the amazing frozen man! Also, gaze at the Frito found in a bag of Doritos! Marvel at the floor that just won\'t come clean!',
'Behold the Can Of Mystery. The label vanished many years ago. What strange wonders lie inside? Treasure? Dog food?',
'Oooh, what a gold mine!',
'Oh, my goodness!',
'Oh no, I could never sell him. He is like a frozen father to me.',
'Hey, who unplugged my freezer? Return to your state of living death at once, sir!',
'Ah, well, Sanjay, that is the end of our freak show. We must relinquish the giddy glamour of show business and return to the humble pleasures of the neighborhood shopkeeper.',
'Come on in!',
'And although my religion strictly forbids military service -- what the hey, I\'m in too.',
'Don\'t ever change.',
'You saved us, Homer.',
'Cheeeese.',
'Do not be alarmed. That is just my helper monkey, sir. I got him after a robber shot me six times and left me for dead.',
'WHO CAN?',
'So what will it be, Mr. Simpson? Your usual bucket of ice cream covered with miniature pies?',
'Oh, well, we have some low-salt candy bars and some reduced-fat soda. And our beef jerky is now nearly rectum-free.',
'Oh yes, that is a new item. No bar contains more applesauce.',
'Yes, sir! One Kwik-E-Dog, one bubble gum cigar, and the latest issue of Success magazine.',
'Yes, I just cleaned out the machine, sir, so the snack you are enjoying has not been soaking in putrid grease.',
'I\'m so sorry, but I sold it all to the rendering plant.',
'Oh yes. They use it to make products such as soap, cosmetics, baby food...',
'That is a puzzlement.',
'Let us roll.',
'You cannot smoke in here! Please, the sign is clearly posted, sir.',
'Ooh. Ooo-la-la Simp-son. Huh. What can I do for you and your new do?',
'Snake? But you\'re dead.',
'No, no, noooooo!',
'Oh, dear. You\'ve ruined my work! You flying fat man!',
'Yes.',
'Right.',
'Uh-huh.',
'Okay, we have none of those. What is next?',
'Mister Simpson, these exotic items are suspiciously different from your usual order of beer and pork. What gives?',
'No, no, no, I know my roars and that was most definitely a safety.',
'Okay, papier-mÃ¢chÃ© mix... pipe cleaners... pig intestines... and sparkle paint.',
'At eleven-thirty?! But this is the peak hour for stoned teenagers buying shiny things.',
'You know, Manjula understands. I told her that endless toil is the only true path out of this jerkwater burg.',
'Oh please, do not be insane, you hosted our wedding. The least we can do is have you over for dinner. It is payback time. And this time it\'s personal.',
'I\'m not checking up on you, Sanjay. I am simply asking you how many pennies you have left. Seven?! I\'ll be right there.',
'This is why I married you. Oof, what an outfit. You are one Mahat-mama.',
'Why I could not let you in the store like that -- because you are smoking.',
'Maybe we should not answer it, huh?',
'Yes, welcome.',
'Who is your favorite Indian pop singer?',
'Oh, sorry.',
'Good rice, good curry. Good Gandhi, let\'s hurry.',
'Try it with rice.',
'Uh-uh. Uh-uh.',
'Uh, say, who\'s up for a game of Ganesh-Gnop?',
'Yes, perhaps I stretched the truth a bit, but the Kwik-E-Mart, she is a harsh mistress.',
'Ah-- Maybe we should just close the door.',
'Manjula, toe isliyÃ© ki mÃ© tumharÃ© liyÃ© acchee cheezÃ© khareed saku.',
'Uh, this could take a while, folks. Thank you, come again.',
'Worse than ever I am afraid. My shameful neglect has made her feel unloved. Now, I fear she will leave me.',
'Ooh, ooh, you are right, there\'s still seven days before Valentine\'s. Ah, seven chances to prove my love for sweet Manjula.',
'Help! I can\'t breathe!',
'Air... need... air.',
'Oh God, my ears are filled with nougat.',
'There\'s a nut in my eye!',
'Okay, here is the message, and please don\'t skimp on the... Sarin?!',
'Homer! What a delightful coincidence.',
'Oh me. My humble love note is turning into a Valentine\'s Day massacre.',
'Elton John!',
'I hate to sound like a screaming fan, but .',
'Shall I take you to the pilot? Huh? You see? Because that is your song.',
'Yes, because someone saved your life tonight!',
'Well, well, the bitch is back.',
'Well, you and the health inspector. Champagne Squishee?',
'It should get you pretty darned hammered.',
'Oh.',
'Yes, I know, but... still.',
'But Mad Dog was wrong. The fire burned through the night, and cost him the use of his pants. Which just goes to show you...',
'Oh!',
'Let\'s just spray it with water, already!',
'You\'ll need a will and headstone, aisle six.',
'Oh! Manjula has begun to ovulate.',
'Hello, Simpsons!',
'Oh, yes sir. Quite happily.',
'I don\'t know exactly. It\'s from the room of lamps that do not look like lamps.',
'Well, sure we have, but the decision to have a child is not to be made lightly.',
'Mm. On the other hand, monkey see, monkey do!',
'Well, perhaps it is time. I\'ve noticed this country is dangerously underpopulated.',
'You know... I do. I mean, there comes a time in a man\'s life when he asks himself, Who will float my corpse down the Ganges?',
'Oh, Calcutta!',
'By chilling my loins, I increase the chances of impregnating my wife.',
'Just stop spouting those hackneyed quips.',
'Here goes nothing...',
'Well, that is a pretty grim assessment.',
'You know, Homer, you might want to open those cans before they explode.',
'O-kay.',
'No, still no luck. Tell me, Homer, did you have to take any special steps when you decided to have children?',
'Well, not to us they don\'t. Oh Homer, we have tried everything! Oysters, gravity boots, Sanjay\'s bed, every possible position...',
'Eh, yes.',
'I\'m willing to play the high school jock, but did you have to cut the roof off my car?',
'Uh, gee, Betsy. It\'s such a nice night. Why don\'t we go all the way?',
'Loosen up, baby. Tomorrow I\'m shipping off to Vietnam. I... I thought I was going to Ivy League State.',
'Homer!',
'No, no, wait a minute. Pirates are wild!',
'Oh, get lost.',
'Of course I do, sweetheart. You\'re beautiful and silky and manageable.',
'That\'s true. But you still have a...',
'Oh, we must drive to the hospital!',
'Cleanup in aisle three.',
'Oh!',
'Oh, you shall be the jewel of our lives.',
'My... Whaa...?!',
'How did we get eight?',
'I too, I am afraid, am guilty of monkeying with nature. I slipped fertility drugs into your breakfast Squishee.',
'Absolutely. Yes.',
'We have a love-eight relationship.',
'No one is on trial. This is a joyous occasion for all. And the outpouring of support has been so lucrative.',
'But the good folks at Sony... ! Their giant TV will really help us love our babies.',
'Oh, they even have a better sound bite than us.',
'Don\'t worry, my little Curry-Face. We don\'t need corporate handouts. Our children will live on love.',
'',
'I just had the most beautiful dream where I died.',
'Listen, I\'ll die when I want to.',
'Thank you, steal again.',
'Ooh, they\'re a ravenous swarm of locusts, just eating and screaming and grabbing and poking and pulling and drooling and two have cradle rash! How do you get cradle rash when you sleep in a suitcase?',
'Shut up!',
'Just shut up!',
'I can\'t believe you don\'t shut up.',
'Welcome to my nightmare.',
'Oh hallelujah, our problems are solved. We have banana bread.',
'I\'m very sorry, we\'ve been rude. Can I offer you something to drink?',
'Okay, break it up.',
'Yes, and what would I pay her with, banana bread? Sorry. Sorry. It\'s just we haven\'t slept in days and we\'re running out of money and... Banana bread! What the hell were you thinking? Banana bread. I apologize, apologize again. As a token of forgiveness, please take this baby.',
'Okay.',
'Who cares? There\'s only one of him!',
'I would say that there must be some sort of horrible catch.',
'The zoo?!',
'Look, I\'m not going to put my babies in a zoo.',
'The habitat?',
'Oh, my goodness!',
'But is it right to put such young children on display?',
'Butch Patrick?!',
'Well, obviously. Hey, one question, Eddie.',
'Eh, right, right. If your mother was a vampire and your father was a Frankenstein, how come you are a werewolf?',
'We wouldn\'t be giving the babies away. We\'d be moving in with them. They\'ll have a traditional zooish upbringing.',
'Hey, what the...',
'Oh, everything is perfect.',
'Showtime?',
'Our babies are not circus freaks! We\'re taking them home now!',
'Not any more!',
'Laminated! You monster!',
'The zookeeper paid you off, didn\'t he?',
'Well, if the police won\'t help us, we\'ll simply have to take the law into our own hands.',
'These animals certainly act different at night.',
'Oh, my little treasures. We\'ll get you out of this terrible place.',
'She\'s waking up!',
'You idiot, those are Colorforms.',
'',
'Nabendu... Pria... and Sashi... Now let\'s go!',
'Oh, let\'s get that awful thing off!',
'Okay, whatever.',
'Now, that is a true friend.',
'We\'ll do our best, Chutney-Butt.',
'Get away from my store, you young hoodlums.',
'I know this is not your way, but we\'re in America now.',
'Whoo, they\'re poking every nook and cranny. Well, every cranny, anyway. So far the nook is relatively... Oh, no it isn\'t!',
'Yes, thank God those days are over.',
'Ned, my friend, please know that the Kwik-E-Mart is there for you, twenty-four hours a day.',
'And I\'m going to give you all of Maude\'s frequent-Squishee points. The boys at headquarters will not like it, but I\'m getting pretty sick of them and their Bombay attitude...',
'They are in the safety cabinet. I\'ll get the key.',
'Hey! You did not pay for that beer!',
'Yes, I finked on Homer. But you know, he deserved it. Never have I seen such abuse of the take a penny, leave a penny tray.',
'Brave Sir Knight, I pray you, climb up and rescue me.',
'Ow!... No, wait... Wait!!',
'Oh, help!',
'All right, root beer, bananas and toilet paper... Fifty percent Out-of-towners\' Tax...',
'I\'m sorry Mrs. Simpson, but we have to charge you foreign devils more.',
'Oh, no worries there. That\'s Henderson\'s Toilet Paper!',
'Not for you.',
'Ready, switch!',
'That was Lisa\'s tree!',
'All right, I\'ll tell you a secret. My bagels are nothing but week-old donuts.',
'',
'This is not a library.',
'Oh, they look wonderful.',
'Actually, he was. He waited with me till the ambulance came, then ran like a deer.',
'A fifty dollar bill!',
'Gentlemen, let us shop.',
'Our wide variety of gum comes in both stick and ball.',
'Are you averse to crispy centers, sir?',
'Then we have much to discuss.',
'Oh, thank you. No more Shiva-related pokings.',
'But we are Hindu.',
'What a rip-off!',
'Hello. I would like to take advantage of your baby prison.',
'Yes, whatever, just take them!',
'Yes, probably!',
'My polite indignation has no bounds.',
'One jug of whiskey... three plugs of tobacky... and some extra-strength opium. That will be two cents, boys.',
'Hey, if you think my prices are high, go across the street.',
'Thank you, come again.',
'No, that is sugar with free donuts.',
'No, it hasn\'t come in yet.',
'Nine one one.',
'I am sorry, but everything in this store, from the honey-glazed cauliflower to the Choco-Blasted Baby Aspirin, comes from the Motherloving Sugar Corporation.',
'Why, right down the street.',
'Mr. Simpson, you are licking blood and Vapo-Rub.',
'There is a small group committed to bringing sugar back to this town. By any means necessary.',
'Gentlemen, I have found the final member of our cabal.',
'There is the island!',
'Well, we\'re almost home.',
'I\'m rowing as fast as I can, sir.',
'Otm Shank. He is India\'s answer to Brian Dennehy. Otm Shank.',
'OH, GIVE ME LAND, LOTS OF LAND / UNDER STARRY SKIES ABOVE...',
'SIR YOU CANNOT PEE / UNLESS YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE...',
'Oh, gentlemen! The new scratch-and-win tickets are out today.',
'Not Choo, Pu.',
'Please gentlemen, violence is not the answer.',
'Some sort of death race? That\'s what I would do.',
'Cheek-a, cheek-a, cheek-a...',
'For the death race!',
'Odysseus, do not forget to thank the gods for our victory with an appropriate animal sacrifice.',
'SacrÃ© Bleeeuu!',
'My fault this time. I didn\'t tuck in my legs.',
'I don\'t know how to feel just now.',
'Manjula!',
'Manjula, why did you bring the octuplets to work? This is supposed to be our special time together.',
'Look, please, can you just take the children home? The porno magazine buyers are too embarrassed to make their move. Look.',
'Clean up in all the aisles.',
'Welcome, steady customer. I see you are ready for the Civil War reenactment.',
'Here you go.',
'I don\'t know which part of that sentence to correct first. But I cannot come. I work 22 hours a day, and then I go home to a wife who will not touch me. The Indian rope trick has become the Indian nope trick.',
'Hello, Annette.',
'Take a penny, leave a penny.',
'Hey, she called me handsome!',
'Ooh, Squishee lady! You\'ve had less than eight kids, haven\'t you? Haven\'t you?',
'Please do the Hindu that you do so well.',
'Avert your eyes, eunuch!',
'Now Manjula, do you want me to find another partner?',
'I know, I know, there will be forty-seven bottles of beer on the wall. Yes. Homer, you did not bring me here for this. What is it that you want to tell me?',
'Is there something you want to tell me?',
'It\'s true. It only happened once, but I am so ashamed. I am scum.',
'What do you think I should do?',
'Yes. First thing in the morning. I promise.',
'Okay Apu, be strong.',
'Before you measure my syrup levels, I must talk to you.',
'As much as I enjoy your company, and I truly do. I must insist that from this point forward we not-- oh my goodness, what are you doing?!',
'Ah, mahatma- hatma-hatma-hatma-hatma-hatma-hatma...',
'Oh, I\'m just happy to lie here, appreciating and respecting you.',
'Nothing! How can you even accuse me of repeated infidelity? I\'m so angry, I could just, I could fall asleep. Completely innocent.',
'This better be good because you are interrupting my faithfulness, and-- Oh, boy.',
'Mmm... that\'s good adultery!',
'Oh, I am so sorry, Manjula! I--',
'Oh, I always thought karma was baloney, but not anymore.',
'Okay.',
'Have you come to forgive me?',
'Oh, I am truly screwed.',
'Manjula, please. I have known we were meant to be together, ever since my mother forced me to marry you. If you give me another chance, I\'ll do anything to make it up to you.',
'Over, under, round and round... so your feet won\'t touch the ground.',
'Now let\'s see what awaits me in the next life.',
'First I was a tiger, a snake, a clod, a goat with a hat... then me...',
'Oh, a tapeworm...',
'then assistant to Lorne Michaels.',
'It\'s going to be a rough couple of lifetimes.',
'Really?',
'#1) Break up with squishee girl. Well, that\'s a no-brainer. #2) Lose weight. #3) Get cartoon published in New Yorker. #4) Legally change name to \'Slime Q. Slimedog.\' #5) Wear nametag that says same.',
'Yes, I\'m afraid so.',
'I only sell Smooshies now. Squishees reminded me of my misdeeds.',
'Yes, but look at the delivery man. He is hideous.',
'Wait a minute. This isn\'t on the list!',
'Not bad, eh?',
'Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?',
'Thank you very much, you big fat blabbermouth. I-- Sorry, sorry, it\'s been a rough month.',
'So... back in the old bed. I never realized it was so wide.',
'Maybe we can\'t rush things.',
'Whenever you are ready.',
'Okay, okay, you\'re the boss.',
'Homer, you are so brave. If anyone deserves to take a penny, it is you.',
'Come on, come on. There\'s only one in there.',
'You took pills you found on the floor?',
'May we talk about, uh... accentuating the... masculine area?',
'And girls that have legs and know how to use them.',
'By orders of the Reality Channel, I must make sure that you only buy items available in 1895.',
'Eh-- Oreos? Sorry, those are from eighteen ninety-six. Non-scarring toilet paper? Oh, dream on. Urkel-O\'s? Delicious, but forbidden.',
'I don\'t believe they had those in eighteen ninety-five.',
'Welcome to your Springfield Mardi Gras headquarters. Cast your vote now for this year\'s king!',
'You were quite the gentleman. Today\'s robbers, they are all smash and grab. You understood the dance.',
'Hello, Mrs. Homer!',
'The bathroom is not for customers. Please use the crack house across the street.',
'Ugh, that is the most pungent thing I have ever smelled, and I am from India! All right, all right, but speak of this to no one!',
'Don\'t worry, that sign is just a ruse -- like all High Voltage signs.',
'Hello, Springfield! Come to my Back-To-School Parking Lot Blow-Out.',
'We\'ve got first-rate school supplies at third-world prices. At the Kwik-E-Mart where we believe in America!',
'Please don\'t beat me up anymore.',
'Sir, would you ask your sweetheart to sign her autograph for me?',
'Oh, so it is. I\'ve already dumped three on Mia Farrow. Sucker!',
'Why are you selling your house?',
'His name is Ned!',
'He is so white bread!',
'Manjula, I\'m so glad you have finally forgiven me for having an affair.',
'She used to elbow me in the face!',
'I must disagree, Mrs. Bart. They\'ve painted this town with a fresh coat of give-a-hoot.',
'Pre-Teen Braves? Is this another of those youth groups that apes the cultures of those indigenous peoples you invaded and destroyed?',
'Mr. Moe. My son was only playing next to this girl who is not your daughter.',
'Oh Mr. Homer, anything for a cuckolded boob, I mean, loyal customer.',
'Nothing, nothing. It just seems your wife has an active imagination.',
'You\'ll see when you read your wife\'s book.',
'If you do you\'ll see she lusts for Flanders.',
'This is how you talk when you learn English from porno movies.',
'Attention American bar devils: it\'s our anniversary! Free drinks for everyone!',
'I have given Manjula many gifts, including a bouquet of flowers, diamond earrings, and we\'re going to see Paris... Hilton. In Paris... Texas. On our way to Paris, France.',
'It\'s application day at Miss Wickerbottom\'s Pre-Nursery School.',
'The fast track begins at birth.',
'That\'s it, claw and bite for position -- only enough tuition money for two. The rest of you: better luck next life!',
'Okay, Farmer Billy\'s slow-killed bacon, Farmer Billy\'s bacon-fed bacon, Farmer Billy\'s travel bacon... Mr. Simpson, if you really want to kill yourself, I also sell handguns.',
'Please, Mr. Simpson, please. I fear your smooches are premature. This is, in fact, a silver ticket.',
'This silver ticket entitles you to judge the pig competition, at the Springfield County Fair.',
'Homer Simpson is the Pie Man? Impossible. He\'s never thrown away a pastry in his life.',
'I did not come to this country illegally to see it mocked.',
'Oh I don\'t think so, it is a heartfelt expression of my true desire to protect my mahogany noggin.',
'No, no. Those are their pre-witch hunt names. Their new names are Freedom, Lincoln, Condoleeza, Coke, Pepsi, Manifest Destiny, Apple Pie and Superman. And together we\'re the MacGillicuddys.',
'Please.',
'I am not a killer! I am but a humble purveyor of disgusting British food.',
'Lark tongues, head pudding, eel pies...',
'Oh Mrs. Simpson, you must pursue your dreams. Like my old dream of coming to America and starting a family. Or my new dream of ditching my family and sneaking back to India in disguise.',
'Apu? Never heard of him. My name is Steve Barnes.',
'It works!... If blue is the color for unimpressed.',
'Oh look, it is Mr. Homer, my favorite customer! Please feel free to paw through my Playdudes and tell me to go back to some country I am not actually from.',
'Please let me come on one of your smuggling runs! My eight babies are driving me crazy! With their coughing and sneezing and general oozing... my Janitor in a Drum is afraid to come out. What does that mean? I don\'t even know. That\'s the kind of bad joke I am making, I am so tired.',
'If you let us come, I will give you ten minutes alone with my Squishee machine, do what you will.',
'No cameras.',
'Homer, tell Mr. Ned to stop trying to convert me!',
'I do not worship one god, okay? I worship a whole super-team of deities that-- Ow! Ow! Okay, he just pinched me!',
'Save me, Shiva!',
'Why don\'t you shut up?',
'Oh, my, hot, hot, hot la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la!',
'La la la la la la la!',
'La la la la la la la la la!',
'I took another sip.',
'Oh, Chintzy-Pop is the worst legal popcorn. Many of the kernels are baby teeth. There are only two idiots cheap enough to buy this crap. You and...',
'Bart, I need you to make a delivery to an elderly shut-in.',
'And to get there, you must go through the forbidden zone.',
'No, no. The one with the uni-clams.',
'Call the police.',
'No change without purchase.',
'A two ounce bag of chips. Five ninety-nine.',
'And you say Mr. Flanders remains completely ignorant of their dot-kama sutra?',
'Uh-oh.',
'You got me... but I shall be reincarnated!',
'Sucker. Twenty-five bucks won\'t buy you a half a Balance Bar. I exaggerate, but really, my prices are very high.',
'As for Apu-D2, I could go either way.',
'WHERE IS MY JOHN WAYNE / WHERE IS MY PRAIRIE SUN / WHERE IS MY HAPPY ENDING / WHERE HAVE ALL THE COWBOYS GONE? / DO DO / DO DO DO / DO DO DO / DO DO DO DO, DO',
'I\'VE JACKED MY PRICES UP SO HIGH / BUT THERE\'S NO JUNK THESE SAPS WON\'T BUY / LAST YEAR\'S EGGNOG / A GREEN HOTDOG...',
'THE CHRISTMAS RUSH HAS CLEANED ME OUT / I JUST HAVE JERKY MADE OF TROUT.',
'Come on, Bart. Throw the dork a bone.',
'Help! Somebody help! That thief stole all my Heralds, Tribunes, and Herald-Tribunes!',
'Thank you, masked vigilante. Your over-zealous homicide has saved me eighty cents. Now if you\'re not going to buy anything, please move along.',
'He used to rob me two, three times a week. Now I\'m lucky if I get it once a month.',
'That is because you\'re robbing my brother Sanjay.',
'If you read one more thing it is a purchase.',
'Purchase!',
'Scandalous!',
'Mrs. Homer! How nice to see you in the Realms.',
'Oh no! I too am online playing! That cobra king over there is actually Snake.',
'And that beguiling enchantress is Mrs. Krabappel!',
'The Shadow Knight! Where he rides, death is sure to follow.',
'He was a good man.',
'A good, moist man.',
'You tell her, Mr. Dhanabhai -- Business contacts are more important than love!',
'Yes, I need to be able to sleep through my wife\'s nagging, and my eight horrible babies and the anguished howls of my ancestors.',
'Ooh! I feel like I\'m floating on a river of corpses.',
'Volunteer fireman? Count me in.',
'Of all the nerve.',
'We are entitled to some sort of compensation. After all, we\'re volunteers.',
'Mr. Burns, jump into this net!',
'What do you think he will give us?',
'Moe, are you suggesting that we should steal?',
'It would be a shame if the next fire you fought... was in Hell!',
'You\'ve just been Apu\'d!',
'',
'Oh my God, if a dead fish and a homeless person had a baby, and the baby puked, and a dog ate the puke, this smells like the rear end of that dog! I\'ll give you any yogurt in the store, just take that thing with you when you go!',
'I sold it all to teenagers. There is a rumor you can mix milk, Mentos and Lotto scrapings to make jetpack fuel.',
'I keep telling you, I\'m Hindu!',
'You mean Dennis Kucinich?',
'Sorry.',
'You talk a good game -- but do you have the product to back it up?',
'You have wasted my time! You have made a very powerless enemy. Good day and be well!',
'You can skip the K and the Y -- I do not thank you and I will not come again.',
'Don\'t worry, Bart -- in India, your cow will be treated like a God and receive the food and medical care that in America would go to human beings.',
'Manjula will sell the store, dye her hair blond and marry my cousin Jangelvar.',
'Well, perhaps she\'s around us now. She may have already been reincarnated as... that newborn baby, or that tiny mouse in the nacho cheese...',
'Oh, what a surprise -- Joe Jesus Junior is gonna set us all straight.',
'That\'s the thing with your religion -- it\'s a bummer.',
'No, the sing-alongs are okay.',
'Mr. Homer, why don\'t you forget your worries with this -- the last lottery ticket on the roll. They say the last one is lucky! Unlike all the others. Lucky! Or not.',
'That is true. Another ironic Tale of the Kwik-E-Mart.',
'What is a four-letter word for hero?',
'Yes, but I meant Lisa!',
'Excuse me, but why not consider an Almond Joy? It looks like you only brought something for yourself, but then you just happen to have two pieces.',
'Excuse me!',
'But, I have been waiting forty-five minutes for you to slide my license over to me.',
'Okay, you are hereby banned from my store. You will have to shop at the Kwik-E-Mart across the street from me. You know, the much nicer, much newer one. Good day to you!',
'Whatever you are looking for, it is not at the bottom of a five hundred and twelve ounce cup of Shrek Berry Blast. What is at the bottom is the Stump Shrek Trivia Quiz which, if answered correctly, entitles you to ten percent off any Shrek DVD -- except the first two.',
'Uh... Ten dollars.',
'No such conversation took place.',
'How about this standee from last year\'s Super Bowl?',
'Well, I don\'t know. I might have some milk that has expired.',
'Ah, here we are... a delightful buttermilk from nineteen sixty-one.',
'Oh, sixty-one. Everyone was twisting again like they did the previous summer.',
'Whatever you do, do not chew the chunks.',
'Hoo boy. Clean up in aisles three... two... one...',
'Psst!',
'This way!',
'Well, as a vegetarian, I did not consume any tainted burgers, and as a convenience store owner, I am armed to the teeth.',
'Shoot her!',
'You can apologize in Hell!',
'I will get out and push. No matter what, Bart must make it to the safe zone.',
'Where are you going?! You were supposed to stop at the bottom and wait for me!',
'Kids, calm down! Here, have a Not Very Berry Blast.',
'So, Lisa, how do you like sharing a bathroom with two brothers?',
'It goes great with our notton candy.',
'Thank you, come again. Who\'s next? Hello',
'Good evening, Mr. Homer, how can I--',
'Ladies and gentlemen, the Orchard Avenue Kwik-E-Mart, birthplace of the yardstick on the doorframe that tells you how tall your robber was, is proud to announce its latest lotto victor... Mr. Barney Gumble!',
'Which flavor do I save -- the Radical Red or the Blueberry Blast? Curse this Squishee\'s choice!',
'Nothing is ever right for you.',
'His kneeeeeee.',
'Where did we get this dreck?',
'Typical. Here\'s the kind of lullaby my sweet mother sang to me:',
'I like Rajiv, Rubaba and the Big Brahmin in the morning! No caste is safe from their merry japes!',
'But you have so much in common with them: nonstop chatter during drive time!',
'I take it back.',
'One of our wives is leaving us for Moe?!',
'That\'s right. She touched his knee.',
'',
'Well, I will end the suspense with a simple cellular phone call to Manjula.',
'No signal?!',
'When a woman is peaceful and content, that means all hell is about to break loose!',
'Oh, no sir. My marriage is solid. Manjula would never cheat on me like I cheated on-- Hoo-boy.',
'May we use your restroom to change our kids out of their cricket uniforms?',
'My one day off and it\'s miserable.',
'You see this? I\'m playing the world\'s smallest sitar for you.',
'We must have left it at that godforsaken pub!',
'How could you forget your own child?!',
'Well, one of us has to go back to Moe\'s... maybe have a beer or two... shoot a game of pool, and if I win I have to play the challenger, such are the customs of billiards...',
'If only that mark on your forehead was an off-button!',
'Hours later, she returned -- smelling of beer and pickled eggs. I know no more.',
'You do?! Tell me!',
'Then what happened?',
'Well, how can you be so sure your wife is not the putty in the bartender\'s hands?',
'The truth...',
'Here it comes. The moment of truth.',
'So it is you, Mr. Homer. But let\'s be honest -- a woman of her age married to a man of-- how old are you? Sixty-five?',
'Dear God, this day gets more and more disturbing.',
'And so it is me.',
'I feel the pain of a thousand Squishee headaches.',
'My worst fears confirmed.',
'You mean you are not leaving me for him?',
'It is true. The tastiest ice cream is the hardest to scoop.',
'',
'Yes, except for... Why did you write that horrible letter?',
'Spit the grapes back in with the others.',
'Say something cruel about me!',
'Yahtzu.',
'Well, maybe he\'s going to jack up our electric rates. I will have to hand-crank my wiener warmer. Hand-crank my wiener warmer.',
'I believe you want the Assistant Manager, sir.',
'Well, that is your bad luck because he is mine right now. Come back in half and hour and he can be your accomplice.',
'What was that?',
'What was that? Ice skating? Do you do axels and Salchows? What do you do?',
'Mister Homer, you inadvertently left your nuclear plant security badge in the birthday card rack.',
'Well, I am more concerned with global terrorism. America\'s enemies would give anything for your nuclear knowledge.',
'And America has so many enemies: Iran, Iraq, China, Mordor, the hoochies that laid low Tiger Woods, undesirable immigrants, by which I mean everyone that came after me... including my children...',
'I paid eight-hundred dollars for five minutes.',
'Help me, my children!',
'What are you after? We\'re a cashless society!',
'Oh, another grandchild. How special.',
'Oh, Sanjay. How I wish that runaway jerky wagon killed me instead of you.',
'I miss you too, Brother.',
'Oh yes, Mr. Homer.',
'Well, the hot dogs spin counterclockwise in fear whenever you are near, sir.',
'Why are you in disguise?',
'Oh really?',
'I am finding out who my real customers are, and who is going to cheat on my store with some South-Sea sugar shack!',
'Now see here. I have always considered you cash-giving cows to be my friends. And friends do not betray friends!',
'Defend yourself, sir!',
'Convenience forever, freshness never!',
'This is a stick-them-up!',
'Because I have a gun, you must stick them up now! Yes, it is loaded, with bullets that you put in my chest. Now empty the cash drawer! Come on!',
'I will chill you, right between your damn eyes! For once, the Indian has been outsourced!',
'Sweet Vishnu the Destroyer, what have I done?',
'But the drumsticks...',
'What now? Swapper Jack is reuniting Led Zeppelin in aisle six?',
'No! Do not give me false hope like the time they said it was only sextuplets.',
'And their chicken pot pie?',
'But how \'bout their rotisserie chi--',
'So, we have won. Finally I am lucky at something.',
'Yeah, sure, baby.',
'Ho-mer! You do not yet understand the meaning of kar-ma!',
'That is beside the point, okay? If something bad is happening to you, it must be because of something you did to others.',
'/',
'In this fantasy Kwik-E-Mart, you get your change in bacon.',
'Please! I\'m missing eight birthday parties for this!',
'Really? Other.',
'I would like to present my Kwik-E-Smart perpetual energy machine.',
'Three years ago, I tripped over the cord.',
'But the hotdogs -- they kept rolling. Some say they\'re powered by decaying nitrates, others by tiny insects beneath the hotdog skins.',
'',
'Hello, Mr. Kirk.',
'I suspect you are buying for underage bullies. But as that is ninety-eight percent of my business, I say thank you, sir! Come again!',
'Oh no, no, no! It is I who will be watching Picasso\'s TV tonight!',
'Thank you!',
'Do not cross -- it is that monster that terrorizes the jolly fat man!',
'Who are you, mysterious octogenarian of the night?',
'That sounds expensive.',
'Sir, can you please turn up the bubbles so we can argue in private here?',
'Oh I remember it! I\'m just pretending I can\'t understand you.',
'And not a single jet more!',
'Oh, what a surprise. A huge new expense you didn\'t tell us about.',
'Ah, Mr. Homer. I see you are wearing the bald man\'s beret.',
'Oh yes. The only thing that screams I am hiding hairlessness more is a goatee.',
'Once again, India is denuded of her treasure by the imperialist devils.',
'Because I like the costumes!',
'Chief Wiggum, how come every time there\'s terrorist chatter in this town, you come to me?',
'Take whatever you want, I don\'t want any trouble, take Jims that are Slim, and gum of the bubble.',
'Noooo!',
'People, I\'m completely out of milk! I do have several DVDs of the movie Milk. An inspiring return to form for director Gus Van Sant!',
'No, but I have home movies of me on a canoe with a big dog.',
'People who\'ve never seen a movie say it is a good movie.',
'I am ruined by whimsy!',
'All sales are final!',
'Don\'t worry, I\'ll radio the coast guard for help.',
'Excuse me... My wife told me about your get-out-of-the-house band. And uh, perhaps you need a singer?',
'WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES / I WISH THAT I COULD FANTASIZE / PULL A DREAM RIGHT OUT OF THE AIR / TAKE A CHANCE TURN IT INTO A PRAYER...',
'It is because of all the years I spent at the Kwik-E-Mart...',
'... where classic rock anthems were piped-in on a never-ending loop. The endless repetition drove many clerks to madness.',
'The only way to maintain my sanity was to sing along until it seemed like our voices were one.',
'HOPIN\' FOR A DREAM...',
'FOCUS LIKE A LASER BEAM / I\'LL KEEP FIGHTING TILL I WANT SOMETHING GREAT / HOPIN\' FOR A DREAM...',
'I think we all felt something.',
'...craft!',
'What if, what if I am no good? This is the Cabbage Festival, man... I-I don\'t know if I can face that crowd!',
'My uniform!',
'All alone at the Kwik-E-Mart.',
'WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES / I WISH THAT I COULD FANTASIZE...',
'PULL A DREAM RIGHT OUT OF THE AIR / TAKE A CHANCE TURN IT INTO A PRAYER...',
'GIRL YOU KNOW I WANNA BE THE GUY / WITH A HUNGER BURNING DEEP INSIDE / TONIGHT I WISH UPON A FALLING STAR / TO DISCOVER WHAT MY YEARNINGS ARE...',
'',
'HOPIN\' FOR A DREAM...',
'Uh, actually... I...',
'Shut your mouth, I want to do it! I want to do it! I want to be a singer for a real rock band!',
'...gazer!',
'But, Mr. Shredder, you promised me after we played my hometown I could have a day off.',
'But the tour is so hard on my family. My octuplets are being raised by roadies and bodyguards.',
'This is not proper.',
'Oh well, I guess it\'s show time.',
'Homer!?',
'What is the point? I am trapped like a Kwik-E-Mart hot dog on a roller.',
'Uh, people? I am sorry to report that all the original members of the band have been struck down by a mysterious case of hot dog poisoning.',
'Rather than refund your money or reschedule the show, we have a surprise for you. Get ready to rock with a group that is truly all about the music -- Covercraft!',
'FOCUS LIKE A LASER BEAM / I\'LL KEEP FIGHTING TILL I WANT SOMETHING GREAT / HOPIN\' FOR A DREAM / HOPIN\' FOR A DREAM',
'TO SOMEDAY SOMEHOW HAVE A GOAL / I\'LL KEEP FIGHTING TILL I WANT SOMETHING GREAT / I\'M HOPIN\' FOR A DREAM',
'HOPIN\' FOR A DREAM...',
'DREAMS ARE GREAT OR SO IT SEEMS / IF I NEVER FIND ONE I GUESS THAT\'S OKAY / I\'M HOPIN\' FOR A DREAM...',
'Well, if you are here for a last minute gift, we have a cellphone holder that fits no cellphone made after two thousand and two, and, uh... Kwik-E-Nog...',
'Nog stands for Not Okayed by Government.',
'',
'',
'',
'',
'Oh please, stop! Stop it! My religion prohibits me from taking advantage of a fool more than five times. This thing basically has no winners.',
'You have been to our schools. What do you think?',
'You know, ironically, in India, they did use the money for schools and they had fantastic results.',
'Well... those hotdogs began life as Twinkies!',
'Chief! I have been shot in the shoulder!',
'Granted, I do not share your faith. But the yahoos in this town need a church to deliver weekly reminders not to steal -- from me, not to take a life -- my life.',
'Now this is what I have got in mind...',
'I will whisper even though we are alone.',
'Please do not call me a heathen. It offends Hanuman, the monkey-headed lord of winds, who believed the sun to be a ripe mango... Okay, I get it. I get why you say it.',
'The Mumbai Institute of Tantric Sex... where I was recruited by a card-counting ring.',
'Card counting is not gambling. It is math.',
'Exactly. If you are caught you cannot be charged with any crime. The worst they will do is beat you with a phone book or break some fingers... But what is a little pain if your church is to be saved!',
'It is all good.',
'Counting cards requires absolute focus. You must ignore all casino distractions.',
'And beware of cocktail waitresses with free drinks and eyeball-height cleavage! They\'re not attractive, but you cannot look away!',
'You -- what is the count?',
'Get your head in the game, Mel!',
'Remember, for this legal but-frowned-upon scheme to work, we must have complete secrecy. Do not tell anyone what you are doing.',
'Card counting is simple.',
'You all sit at different tables, betting low, playing hand after hand, counting in your head how many high cards are left in the deck.',
'Ignore all distractions!',
'When the count is high, you have a hot deck and the odds are in your favor. Then, you use a secret signal to call in The Closer.',
'The Closer bets big, wins bigger, and the casino never suspects that it has been the victim of a morally-acceptable screw job.',
'But use caution. There are eyes everywhere. Sooner or later, the casino will catch on...',
'Okay, okay, don\'t get cocky, you rapture-waiting baby-baptizers! You had one good night, but now the casino is on to you. They\'re not going to let you anywhere near those blackjack tables... unless you wear these.',
'Hello, steady customer. How are you this evening, sir?',
'What\'s the matter, sir? Never have I seen you look so unhappy while purchasing such a large quantity of ice cream.',
'Yes, yes, I know the procedure for armed robbery. I do work in a convenience store, you know.',
'You can emerge now from my chips. The opportunity to prove yourself a hero is long gone.',
'Okay, okay. Don\'t try anything funny. I\'m armed to the teeth.',
'Hey, hey. This is not a lending library. If you\'re not going to buy that thing, put it down or I\'ll blow your heads off.',
'Ooh! Somebody\'s having a party.',
'Thank you, but this store is open twenty-four hours. It puts great demands on my time.',
'Oh, the fight. Why didn\'t you say something? I\'ll get my brother, Sanjay, to cover for me. He deplores violence of all kinds.',
'Oh Hello, Mrs. Homer. I have brought an assortment of jerkies.',
'Certainly not. What has been implied here?',
'Everyone to my place for blueberry Squishees and microwave burritos!',
'What a donnybrook game, Mr. Burns.',
'I am loathe to interrupt your meditation. But the time has come for money to change hands.',
'Here you go. Smoke them in good health. And will you be needing any lottery tickets with that?',
'You! Wandering mongrel! Get out of my Mom and Pop operation!',
'Hello, Mrs. Homer!',
'I\'ve just enrolled in a screenwriting class. I yearn to tell the story of an idealistic young Hindu pushed too far by convenience store bandits. I call it, Hands Off My Jerky, Turkey!',
'Oh, thank you. Actually, my brother Sanjay thought of it.',
